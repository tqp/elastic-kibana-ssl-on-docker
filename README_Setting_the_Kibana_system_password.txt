Kibana uses the 'kibana_system' user to connect to Elastic.
The password to 'kibana_system' should be changed to match the one listed in the Kibana Docker Compose file (or .env file):
      - ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME=kibana_system
      - ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD=$KIBANA_PASSWORD

Normally, you'd do this by going to the 'bin' directory on an Elasticsearch server and running:
elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive

BUT, when SSL is enabled (i.e., xpack.security.enabled = true), when you run this, you'll get the following error:

WARN  org.elasticsearch.common.ssl.DiagnosticTrustManager - failed to establish trust with server at [172.28.0.2]; the server provided a certificate with subject name [CN=tqp-elasticsearch-01] and fingerprint [8c4b6170e0c1ebaa470383069f3cebd68d541331]; the certificate has subject alternative names [DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1,DNS:tqp-elasticsearch-01]; the certificate is issued by [CN=Elastic Certificate Tool Autogenerated CA] but the server did not provide a copy of the issuing certificate in the certificate chain; the issuing certificate with fingerprint [79405b03687b9888ffedef676beb426ba4d023d9] is trusted in this ssl context ([xpack.security.http.ssl])
java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative names matching IP address 172.28.0.2 found

The solution is to run this command instead:
elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive -u 'https://hostname.example.com:9200/'
